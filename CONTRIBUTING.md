# Contributing to Opacus Lab

Opacus Lab is meant to be a repository for research and experimental code related to Opacus. We use Opacus Lab to include features that are too niche or not mature enough to integrate to the main Opacus repository.

> :warning: **DISCLAIMER**: We are a small team, so at this time we can only commit to supporting the stable code we land in Opacus main repository. This means we normally would not maintain Opacus Lab and generally would not monitor contributions and accept pull requests. We offer this code as-is to develop in the open together with our community. You are free to use it in your own research (if you do, just cite Opacus. No need to cite this repo).
Even though we do not accept pull requests to this repo, if you used or modified this code to do something cool let us know in the [forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org/c/opacus/29).
