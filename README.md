# Opacus Lab

Research and experimental code related to [Opacus](https://opacus.ai), a library that enables training PyTorch models with differential privacy.

Opacus Lab is meant to be an experimental counterpart of the main [Opacus](https://opacus.ai) repository; it is used to include and experiment with features that are too niche or not mature to be included in the main repository.

> :warning: **WARNING**: This code is considered experimental and we provide it as-is to the community as we develop it in the open source. We do not offer support for this code, nor do we maintain a pip package for it with releases. You are welcome to install from source and tinker with it as well as talk to us about it, preferably in our forum (https://discuss.pytorch.org/c/opacus/29).
